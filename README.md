# QuantumKernelML
Tutorial on QKML using Qiskit and Sklearn
This tutorial is based on a paper by Suzuki et. al., which itself is a study of the pioneering paper Supervised learning with quantum-enhanced feature spaces by Havlíček et.al. [1,2]. Suzuki et. al in their paper, study a two qubit classifier.
